# Game Tree Search

This TDD Kata was inspired by a message at Test-Driven Development Yahoo Group. 
The original message at [Implementation of game tree search using TDD](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/message/35419).

## Problem

The requirement is to traverse a tree to a specified depth and find the
maximum value of the nodes at this depth. If a path ends before the
specified depth then the value of the last node in the path should be
considered.
